# Innovonto-Ontology
The Innovonto Ontology: Describe Ideas in a Graph Format based on GI2MO

## Building the Docs
Build the docs by using

    make build
    
If you want to clean the directory, use

    make clean
    

## Running
If you want to look at the webVOWL visualization, you have to run a local server, due to CORS.

Run the server (in the main dir) with:

    php -S localhost:8081

and then browse to:

localhost:8081/docs/index-en.html

1. How to model the seuqence of answerItems for a comprehension question?

    A Bag (a resource having type rdf:Bag) represents a group of resources or literals, possibly including duplicate members, where there is no significance in the order of the members. For example, a Bag might be used to describe a group of part numbers in which the order of entry or processing of the part numbers does not matter.

    A Sequence or Seq (a resource having type rdf:Seq) represents a group of resources or literals, possibly including duplicate members, where the order of the members is significant. For example, a Sequence might be used to describe a group that must be maintained in alphabetical order.

    An Alternative or Alt (a resource having type rdf:Alt) represents a group of resources or literals that are alternatives (typically for a single value of a property). For example, an Alt might be used to describe alternative language translations for the title of a book, or to describe a list of alternative Internet sites at which a resource might be found. An application using a property whose value is an Alt container should be aware that it can choose any one of the members of the group as appropriate.

## Challenge Modeling
IdeaContest
     IdeaContest - An instance of this class represents the so-called Idea Contests (also referred as "idea campaign", "idea event" etc.). Idea contests are events that stimulate idea submission, bind ideas tematically and attach their collection to a particular time period. 
     

Challenge
    One specific instance (for example different research descriptions)
    -> Links to IdeaContest
    
Application Case -> Remove


1. Crowdsourcing Batch -> Challenge
2. Challenge -> IdeaContest
3. Application Case -> Remove

AC1: Ist TCO ein ApplicationCase? Ein IdeaContest?

Greenhouse needs export!
 -> But only in XML/RDF because then we can import it in innovonto-core / elaborator-Application
