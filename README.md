# Innovonto-Ontology
The Innovonto Ontology: Describe Ideas in a Graph Format based on GI2MO

## Building the Docs
Build the docs by using

    make build
    
If you want to clean the directory, use

    make clean
    

## Running
If you want to look at the webVOWL visualization, you have to run a local server, due to CORS.

Run the server (in the main dir) with:

    php -S localhost:8081

and then browse to:

localhost:8081/docs/index-en.html
